# Getting Started

## Path A: Running Experiments

Download the standalone installer from the [labrynth releases page](https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/labrynth/releases). The installer bundles the Python backend, React frontend, and firmware binaries into a single desktop application -- no development environment required.

## Path B: Development

Clone the repositories you need and set up the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repositories you need
git clone https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/reacher.git
git clone https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/labrynth.git
git clone https://github.com/Otis-Lab-MUSC/reacher-firmware.git

# Install the Python backend
cd reacher
pip install -e .

# Build the frontend
cd ../labrynth
npm install
npm run build
```
